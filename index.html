				<p>Space Hippie is a story of trash transformed. From the upper to the outsole, 
                Space Hippie 04 is made of at least 25% recycled material by weight. 
                Not only is it the most lightweight silhouette within the collection, 
                it also has the lowest carbon footprint. Its ‘Space Waste Yarn’ upper includes about 75% recycled content
                 by weight–made from recycled plastic bottles, t-shirts and yarn scraps. 
                 A soft, Crater Foam midsole combines Nike grind with a blend of foams for stability 
                 and a unique aesthetic.</p>
